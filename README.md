Range-Doppler ambiguity graphs of a target using Golay transmitted signal
- Perform matched filtering for range estimation in the time domain and frequency
domain
- Perform 2D range-Doppler processing for a moving target
- Repeat exercise for multiple targets (three)
- Perform cell averaged CFAR-based detection of target parameters (amplitude,
range, and Doppler)
- Repeat the above exercises for Doppler resilient Golay sequences
